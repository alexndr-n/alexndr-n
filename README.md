# ‚ú® Welcome! ‚ú®

My name is Alejandro and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer working mainly on Full Stack Typescript projects for US based clients. I have worked with all three frontend javascript frameworks, as well as in the most diverse back-end architectures, while also taking care of CI/CD and DevOps in many of the projects I have been in.

I am looking to join some Open Source Typescript projects as a collaborator, I'm open to suggestions!
